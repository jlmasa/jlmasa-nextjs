                This is CS50x , Harvard University&apos;s introduction to the
                intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of
                programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without
                prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by
                David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think
                algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include
                abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation,
                resource management, security, software engineering, and web
                development. Languages include C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript
                plus CSS and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains
                of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. The
                on-campus version of CS50x , CS50, is Harvard&apos;s largest
                course.

                Students who earn a satisfactory score on 9 problem sets (i.e.,
                programming assignments) and a final project are eligible for a
                certificate. This is a self-paced courseâ€“you may take CS50x on
                your own schedule.

                This hands-on computer workshop will introduce you to digital
                video imaging and editing with Adobe Premiere. Throughout this
                intensive three-day course, you will learn the interface of
                Adobe Premiere and how to import a wide range of audio, video,
                graphics and animation files into your projects. See how to use
                non-linear editing to produce video for corporate, training, Web
                or other applications. Apply professional-quality special
                effects and transitions between video clips. Explore digital
                compositing, 2D animation and time-based special effects. At the
                end of the workshop, you will be able to assemble your own mini
                video presentation for class viewing.
